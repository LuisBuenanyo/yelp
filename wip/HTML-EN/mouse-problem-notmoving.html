 If you have a mouse with a cable, check that it is firmly plugged in to
 your computer.
 </p>
<p class="p">
 If it is a USB mouse (with a rectangular connector), try plugging it in to a
 different USB port. If it is a PS/2 mouse (with a small, round connector with
 six pins), make sure that it is plugged in to the green mouse port rather
 than the purple keyboard port. You may need to restart the computer if it was
 not plugged in.

    exactly as it appears here,
   and press <span class="key"><kbd>Enter</kbd></span>.

<li class="steps"><p class="p">A short list of mouse devices will appear. Check that at least one of the
   items says <span class="sys">[XExtensionPointer]</span> next to it, and that one of the
   <span class="sys">[XExtensionPointer]</span> items has the name of the mouse to the left of
   it.</p></li>
<li class="steps"><p class="p">If there is no entry that has the name of the mouse followed by
   <span class="sys">[XExtensionPointer]</span>, then the mouse was not recognized by your
   computer. If the entry exists, your mouse was recognized by your computer.
   In this case you should check that the mouse is

<p class="p">
 If your mouse has a serial (RS-232) connector, you may need to perform some
 extra steps to get it working. The steps might depend on the make or model of
 your mouse.
 </p>
<p class="p">
 It can be complicated to fix problems with mouse detection. Ask for support
 from your distribution or vendor if you think that your mouse has not been
 detected properly.

<li class="list"><p class="p">Make sure the mouse is turned on. There is often a switch on the

<li class="list"><p class="p">
   Click a button and see if the mouse pointer moves now. Some wireless mice go
   to sleep to save power, so might not respond until you click a button.
   See <span class="link"><a href="mouse-wakeup.html" title="Mouse reacts with delay before it starts working">Mouse reacts with delay before it starts working</a></span>.

<li class="list"><p class="p">
   Check that the battery of the mouse is charged.

<li class="list"><p class="p">
   Make sure that the receiver (dongle) is firmly plugged in to the computer.
   </p></li>
<li class="list"><p class="p">
   If your mouse and receiver can operate on different radio channels, make
   sure that they are both set to the same channel.
   </p></li>
<li class="list"><p class="p">
   You may need to press a button on the mouse, receiver or both to establish
   a connection. The instruction manual of your mouse should have more details
   if this is the case.
   </p></li>
</ul></div></div></div>
<p class="p">
 Most RF (radio) wireless mice should work automatically when you plug them
 into your computer. If you have a Bluetooth or IR (infrared) wireless mouse,
 you may need to perform some extra steps to get it working. The steps might
 depend on the make or model of your mouse.
