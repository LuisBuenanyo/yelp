<p class="p">If you're sure that you entered the correct <span class="link"><a href="net-wireless-wepwpa.html" title="What do WEP and WPA mean?">wireless password</a></span> but you still can't successfully connect to a wireless network, try some of the following:</p>
<div class="list"><div class="inner"><div class="region"><ul class="list">
<li class="list">
<p class="p">Double-check that you have the right password</p>
<p class="p">Passwords are case-sensitive (it matters whether they have capital or lower-case letters), so check that you didn't get the case of one of the letters wrong.</p>
</li>
<li class="list">
<p class="p">Try the hex or ASCII pass key</p>
<p class="p">The password you enter can also be represented in a different way - as a string of characters in hexadecimal (numbers 0-9 and letters a-f) called a pass key. Each password has an equivalent pass key. If you have access to the pass key as well as the password/passphrase, try typing the pass key instead. Make sure you select the correct <span class="gui">wireless security</span> option when asked for your password (for example, select <span class="gui">WEP 40/128-bit Key</span> if you're typing the 40-character pass key for a WEP-encrypted connection).</p>
</li>
<li class="list">
<p class="p">Try turning your wireless card off and then on again</p>
<p class="p">Sometimes wireless cards get stuck or experience a minor problem that means they won't connect. Try turning the card off and then on again to reset it - see <span class="link"><a href="net-wireless-troubleshooting.html" title="Wireless network troubleshooter">Wireless network troubleshooter</a></span> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li class="list">
<p class="p">Check that you're using the right type of wireless security</p>
<p class="p">When prompted for your wireless security password, you can choose which type of wireless security to use. Make sure you choose the one that is used by the router or wireless base station. This should be selected by default, but sometimes it will not be for some reason. If you don't know which one it is, use trial and error to go through the different options.</p>
</li>
<li class="list">
<p class="p">Check that your wireless card is properly supported</p>
<p class="p">Some wireless cards aren't supported very well. They show up as a wireless connection, but they can't connect to a network because their drivers lack the ability to do this. See if you can get an alternative wireless driver, or if you need to perform some extra set-up (like installing a different <span class="em">firmware</span>). See <span class="link"><a href="net-wireless-troubleshooting.html" title="Wireless network troubleshooter">Wireless network troubleshooter</a></span> for more information.</p>
